**Project has been canceled due to low demand**

This bot scrapes the sportsworld165.com website for the latest's in demand fitted hats.

At the time of making the bot I was able to detect a .atom file in the source code [source](https://sportsworld165.com/collections/new-arrivals/fitted.atom) that
has all the latests releases that would update everyday at [4:00PM PST]() on Wednesday's.

After parseing the list I could make an embed and send it through Discord with a webhook.

example discord notification:
